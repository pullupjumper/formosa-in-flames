---@param attackerGUID string The GUID of the attacker unit
---@param contactGUID string The GUID of the target contact
---@param attackingSideGUID string The GUID of the attacking side
---@return table|nil @ Returns an weapon allocation table

---Example: ScenEdit_WeaponAllocation('', 'contactGUID', 'attackingSideGUID') supply contact GUID and empty attacker to see salvos against contact. Note in this case, you MUST supply the side from which attacks are coming from.
---Example: ScenEdit_WeaponAllocation('attackerGUID', 'contactGUID', '') supply attacker and contact GUIDs to see salvos generated between the 2
